- Data Visualisation

## Image Generation Model Fine-Tuning

Project to practice my skills learned after completing a course on creating and training diffusion models [FastAI: Practical AI for Deep Learning (Part 2)](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson9.html). Here I fine-tuned Stable Diffusion for help generating character artwork for my friends' Dungeons and Dragons campaigns.

- Model Training
- Model Architecture Design
- Large Model Fine-Tuning
- Machine Learning Foundations
