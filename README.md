# ML Projects

## Recipe Generator [[Link]](https://github.com/stephankostov/recipe-generator)

A project to have fun and practice data wrangling and training models.

- Data Engineering
- Model Architecture Design
- Model Training

## Podcast Transcriber [[Link]](https://github.com/stephankostov/podcast-transcriber) 

A practical project to help notetaking.

- AI-Agent Development
- NLP
- LLM Prompt Engineering

## Data Analytics MSc Dissertation [[Link]](https://github.com/stephankostov/msc-data-analysis-thesis)

My first real taste of working with data.

- Data Analysis
- Data Visualisation

## Image Generation Model Fine-Tuning

Project to practice my skills learned after completing a course on creating and training diffusion models [FastAI: Practical AI for Deep Learning (Part 2)](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson9.html). Here I fine-tuned Stable Diffusion for help generating character artwork for my friends' Dungeons and Dragons campaigns.

- Model Training
- Model Architecture Design
- Large Model Fine-Tuning
- Machine Learning Foundations

# Reading List

- [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/): My introduction to in-depth training of Machine Learning models of (at the time) state of the art architectures through the creation of a generalised Python training library, designed by a master ML tinkerer Jeremy Howard.
- [Course: Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion by Jeremy Howard](https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/part2.html): A ground-up approach to getting to know Machine Learning at its core. Done through gradually building up to PyTorch modules starting from nothing but the Python standard library, and adding them only once they had been implemented with the foundations prior. Ultimately this was done to then implement and train a Stable Diffusion model.
- [Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/book/): An in-depth explanation of the core of data aggregation, and visualisation in Pandas by the founder of Pandas himself.
- [Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/): A modern overview and best-practices of all parts of Machine Learning systems from Data Engineering to Model selection, training, and deployment.
- [Mathematics for Machine Learning by Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, and Cheng Soon Ong](https://mml-book.github.io/): A refresher of the maths behind ML in order to better follow most recent research.
